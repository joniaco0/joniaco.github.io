    "text": "The philosophy that you need to run the ball to win is one that is hotly debated in Sports Circles. But teams in the Big Ten and ACC conference have gotten away with winning games despite not rushing for 100 Yards. The difference between the two is that they’ve flipflopped positions in the past two years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlogs &lt;- read.csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs1124.csv\")\nsub100 &lt;- logs|&gt; filter(RushingYds &lt;= 100)\nsub100W &lt;- sub100 |&gt; filter(Outcome == \"W\")\ndata &lt;- sub100W |&gt; group_by(Season,Conference) |&gt; summarize(Wins = n())\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Season'.

When we load in the data of Sub 100 Yard Rushing games, it’s not pretty, as expected, there were 5122 Sub-100 Yard rushing games since 2011. Only 1096 of them were wins. This comes out to a 21% win percentage, which is not very good.\n\n\nCode\nWins &lt;- sub100W |&gt; summarise(Count = n()) |&gt; pluck(1)\nTotal &lt;- sub100  |&gt; summarise(Count = n()) |&gt; pluck(1)\nWinpct &lt;- (Wins/Total)\nWinpct\n\n\n[1] 0.2139789\n\n\nIn the Big Ten, this is no exception, with a slightly better win percentage than the national average, the Big Ten had a little more than a half of a percentage point better when it came to Sub-100 Yard rushing wins.\n\n\nCode\nbigtensub &lt;- sub100 |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\")\nbigtenw &lt;- bigtensub |&gt; filter(Outcome == \"W\")\nBigWins &lt;- bigtenw |&gt; summarise(Count = n()) |&gt; pluck(1)\nBigTotal &lt;- bigtensub |&gt; summarise(Count = n()) |&gt; pluck(1)\nBigWinPct &lt;- BigWins/BigTotal\nBigWinPct\n\n\n[1] 0.2197232\n\n\nWell what teams get away with these performances? Surprisingly, the conference that has had the most amount of games with Sub-100 Yard Rushing is the Big Ten, the rough and tough conference that loves to run the ball according to fans. But when you look at wins after these performances, the ACC reigns supreme.\n\n\nCode\ntotalseasondata &lt;- sub100 |&gt; group_by(Conference)|&gt; summarize(Games = n())\ntotalseasondata |&gt; arrange(desc(Wins))\n\n\n# A tibble: 14 × 2\n   Conference                   Games\n   &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;int&gt;\n 1 American Athletic Conference   395\n 2 Atlantic Coast Conference      559\n 3 Big 12 Conference              344\n 4 Big East Conference             60\n 5 Big Ten Conference             578\n 6 Conference USA                 576\n 7 Independent                    145\n 8 Mid-American Conference        515\n 9 Mountain West Conference       424\n10 Pac-12 Conference              457\n11 Pacific-12 Conference           45\n12 Southeastern Conference        509\n13 Sun Belt Conference            455\n14 Western Athletic Conference     60\n\n\nCode\nseasondata &lt;- sub100W |&gt; group_by(Conference)|&gt; summarize(Wins = n())\nseasondata |&gt; arrange(desc(Wins))\n\n\n# A tibble: 14 × 2\n   Conference                    Wins\n   &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Atlantic Coast Conference      150\n 2 Big Ten Conference             127\n 3 Pac-12 Conference              127\n 4 Southeastern Conference        121\n 5 Conference USA                  99\n 6 Mountain West Conference        96\n 7 American Athletic Conference    78\n 8 Big 12 Conference               78\n 9 Sun Belt Conference             75\n10 Mid-American Conference         73\n11 Independent                     26\n12 Big East Conference             17\n13 Pacific-12 Conference           16\n14 Western Athletic Conference     13\n\n\nBut when you look season by season, you can see a trend between the Big Ten and ACC Conference moving in different directions. The Big Ten was one of the worst teams in the country in getting wins from Sub-100 Rushing Yard games, with more games in 2011 than the ACC, yet only six wins. In that same year, the ACC had 16 wins, more than double that of the Big Ten. But over time, these conferences almost swapped places, with 2021 the most glaring change, as the Big Ten had 20 wins compared to the ACC’s 10.\n\n\nCode\ntotaldata &lt;- sub100 |&gt; group_by(Season,Conference) |&gt; summarize(Games = n()) |&gt; arrange((Season))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Season'.

There are a couple of reasons, but the biggest one is that the Big Ten didn’t see many teams score wins from Sub-100 rushing yard performances in 2011, with only 5 in 2011. In the same year, the ACC saw five teams win twice after rushing under 100 yards, and nine total teams scoring at least one win. This happens in reverse in 2021, with eight teams in the Big Ten getting at least one win from Sub-100 yard rushing performances, with Purdue and Penn State combining for 10 Wins by themselves. The ACC only had five teams that were able to get one Sub-100 Yard rushing win.\n\n\nCode\nTeamsdata &lt;- sub100W |&gt; group_by(Season,TeamFull,Conference) |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\"|Conference == \"Atlantic Coast Conference\")|&gt; summarize(Wins = n())\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Season', 'TeamFull'.

To do this we can use summarize and group by each play type to see what teams call.\n\n\nCode\nthird_and_six|&gt; group_by(play_type) |&gt; summarize(Count = n()) |&gt; mutate(Percentage = (Count / sum(Count)) * 100)|&gt; arrange(desc(Count)) \n\n\n# A tibble: 22 × 3\n   play_type                  Count Percentage\n   &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Pass Reception              4676     29.9  \n 2 Pass Incompletion           3866     24.7  \n 3 Rush                        3173     20.3  \n 4 Penalty                     1068      6.82 \n 5 Timeout                      929      5.93 \n 6 Sack                         800      5.11 \n 7 Passing Touchdown            496      3.17 \n 8 Interception Return          257      1.64 \n 9 Rushing Touchdown            135      0.862\n10 Fumble Recovery (Opponent)   101      0.645\n# ℹ 12 more rows\n\n\nRush plays are around 20% according to this, but there are a couple other play types such as fumble recovery that may have been rushes before hand. Filtering by intial rush from CFBfastr’s dataset, we can find a more accurate number for rushes.\n\n\nCode\nrushes &lt;- third_and_six|&gt; filter(rush == 1)\nrushcount &lt;-  rushes|&gt; summarise(Count = n()) |&gt; pluck(1)\npasses &lt;- third_and_six|&gt; filter(pass == 1) |&gt; summarise(Count = n()) |&gt; pluck(1)\ntotal &lt;- rushcount+passes\nperct &lt;- (rushcount/total) * 100\nperct\n\n\n[1] 24.88618\n\n\nOk so only 24% of the time teams run on Third and Six, it doesn’t seem too optimal, but not super rare. How many yards on average do these teams gain when they run on third and six?\n\n\nCode\navgrush &lt;- rushes|&gt; summarize(mean(yards_gained))\navgrush\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `mean(yards_gained)`\n                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                 6.08\n\n\nOn average, they rush for the first down, which is pretty suprising considering the spread of the play usage. From here, lets see what teams run the most on third and six, and spolier alert, it’s teams that rely on the run the most.\n\n\nCode\nteamrushes &lt;- rushes |&gt; group_by(pos_team) |&gt; summarize(Count = n(),Avg_Yards_Gained = mean(yards_gained)) |&gt; arrange(desc(Count))\nteamrushes\n\n\n# A tibble: 280 × 3\n   pos_team         Count Avg_Yards_Gained\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Navy                60             4.22\n 2 Army                51             4.14\n 3 Air Force           42             5.69\n 4 Georgia Southern    35             5.89\n 5 New Mexico          32             6.47\n 6 Ole Miss            31             4.77\n 7 Kent State          30             6.6 \n 8 Baylor              29             9.03\n 9 Georgia Tech        29             7.55\n10 Louisiana           29             6.45\n# ℹ 270 more rows\n\n\nThe service academies do it the most, they also rely on the run game more than most in the nation. That could explain how their averages are lower than some of the other teams on this list. How does Maryland compare?\n\n\nCode\nteamrushes |&gt; filter(pos_team == \"Maryland\")\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  pos_team Count Avg_Yards_Gained\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Maryland    17             6.41\n\n\nSo on average, Maryland gets the first down on Third and Six when they run the ball. They also don’t run it too often. How does this look visually when comparing all schools?\n\n\nCode\numd &lt;- teamrushes|&gt; filter(pos_team == \"Maryland\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\ngeom_point(data = teamrushes, aes(x=Count, y=Avg_Yards_Gained), color = \"gray\", size = 1)+ \ngeom_point(data = umd, aes(x=Count, y=Avg_Yards_Gained), color = \"red\", size = 2)+\ngeom_hline(yintercept = 6, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"blue\")+\n  labs(title = \"Maryland on average gets the first down with rushes on third and six \", x = \"Count\", y = \"Avg Yards Gained\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this, it’s easy to draw the conclusion that this was the right decison. Maryland has had a good amount of success running it on third and six, and this was an educated decison. Well lets look at the history of Maryland running it on Third and Six. How many were successful?\n\n\nCode\nfirstdown &lt;- rushes |&gt; filter(pos_team == \"Maryland\") |&gt; select(season,pos_team,yards_gained,wpa)|&gt;  mutate(First_Down = ifelse(yards_gained &gt;= 6, TRUE, FALSE))|&gt; arrange((wpa))\nfirstdown\n\n\n# A tibble: 17 × 5\n   season pos_team yards_gained        wpa First_Down\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;     \n 1   2023 Maryland           -1 -0.099     FALSE     \n 2   2022 Maryland           -2 -0.0701    FALSE     \n 3   2022 Maryland            1 -0.0649    FALSE     \n 4   2021 Maryland            5 -0.0143    FALSE     \n 5   2023 Maryland            5 -0.0140    FALSE     \n 6   2022 Maryland            3 -0.00593   FALSE     \n 7   2024 Maryland            5 -0.00304   FALSE     \n 8   2022 Maryland            6 -0.000840  TRUE      \n 9   2019 Maryland            3 -0.0000001 FALSE     \n10   2021 Maryland            8  0.0000127 TRUE      \n11   2021 Maryland            8  0.0000732 TRUE      \n12   2021 Maryland            5  0.00107   FALSE     \n13   2022 Maryland           21  0.00163   TRUE      \n14   2023 Maryland           15  0.00239   TRUE      \n15   2023 Maryland           12  0.0645    TRUE      \n16   2022 Maryland            7  0.0648    TRUE      \n17   2023 Maryland            8  0.0699    TRUE      \n\n\nOf those 17 times, 8 of them reached first down, and three were over 12 yards. On the other hand, of every time Maryland ran on Third and Six, their 1 yard loss was the most consquential of any of the plays listed about according to WPA.\nSo what’s the answer? The answer is it’s not as simple as what the normal fan would call a bad call. Running it on third and six seems like giving up, but in reality Maryland has found some success in the past and don’t do it as much. That being said, the success of this play historically is close to a coin flip and really depends on the team they play."

The Big Ten was one of the worst teams in the country in getting wins from Sub-100 Rushing Yard games, with more games in 2011 than the ACC, yet only six wins. In that same year, the ACC had 16 wins, more than double that of the Big Ten.

There are a couple of reasons, but the biggest one is that the Big Ten didn’t see many teams score wins from Sub-100 rushing yard performances in 2011, with only 5 in 2011. In the same year, the ACC saw five teams win twice after rushing under 100 yards, and nine total teams scoring at least one win. This happens in reverse in 2021, with eight teams in the Big Ten getting at least one win from Sub-100 yard rushing performances, with Purdue and Penn State combining for 10 Wins by themselves. The ACC only had five teams that were able to get one Sub-100 Yard rushing win.\n\n\nCode\nTeamsdata &lt;- sub100W |&gt; group_by(Season,TeamFull,Conference) |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\"|Conference == \"Atlantic Coast Conference\")|&gt; summarize(Wins = n())\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Season', 'TeamFull'.
